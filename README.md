# byBrick fancyBox Plugin #

byBrick fancyBox Plugin is a WordPress plugin that enables fancyBox 2.1.0 and adds rel="fancybox" to all image links. Although this plugin is GPL2, remember that fancyBox by FancyApps isn't and you must buy a license in order to use this for any commercial projects. Read more about the license http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#license

## Version

*	1.0
	No options, no fancyBox helpers, no nothing basically. It adds rel="fancybox" to you images and opens them with fancyBox. Let's keep it simple for now, might add more options later, but for now; it does what I want it to do.

## Credits

* This plugin re-uses code from [DefProc](http://profiles.wordpress.org/DefProc/)'s plugin [add-rel-lightbox](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-rel-lightbox/). Thank you for that.
